# Text Adventure
I want this to be an LLM generate text adventure. Every character, scene, location, choice, reaction, etc 
is generated by an LLM. Each model should have it's own generator class with a custom prompt for generating that specific type. Once something has been generated, that information then gets stored and becomes
a permanent part of the world and story that is being created.

All interactions with AI should use structured schema output.

When the protagonist interacts with a character, the character should respond based on the context of their
own backstory.

For speed, I will probably need to use smaller, local models if possible.


# Interaction design (first use)
- user runs the program
- they receive a series of prompts asking them to describe the story they want to experience
    - comedy, tragedy, romance
    - realistic, fantasy, magic, etc
    - anything else we need in order set the parameters for the story
    - character name
    - character sex
- after they have entered all of these details, we generate:
    - universe
    - preface
    - first location description
    - random number of other characters for the first scene
    - first scene description to include where the other characters are in the room
- we then feed all that information back to the UI as the first scene description
- the user then enters whatever text they desire
- with the user's input we
    - determine if we can understand it
    - determine if it is allowed by the laws of the universe of the game
    - determine if they are interacting with any of the other characters in the location
    - based on the user's action, we generate a response from each other character in the room
